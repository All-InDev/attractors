# How To Translate

Note: there's about 800 words to translate. Thankfully not as word-heavy as my other projects!

**Step 1)** Fork or clone this repo!

**Step 2)**
Look up the two-letter code of the language you're translating to:
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
COPY `index.html`, and name the copy `[your-two-letter-code].html`.
For example: `de.html`, `ar.html`, `zh.html`, etc...

**Step 3)** Translate THAT page (800 words).
Do *not* modify the original `index.html`!
Also, please feel free to credit yourself as a translator :)

**Step 4)** Send a Pull Request so I can make your translation go live!

**Step 5)** ðŸŽ‰
