A pro-democracy movement can rally against a dictatorship for years and years, and nothing much changes. Then suddenly, *everything* changes.

Why do many complex systems â€“ governments, environments, economies â€“ seem stuck (or if good, "stable") despite lots of effort to change them? And why, when change *does* come, it seems to change (or if bad, "collapse") all at once?

There's a tool that can help us understand this: **attractor landscape diagrams**. Or, in less pretentious words: "you draw a ball rolling down some hills". This tool was first created in the field of physics, but has since then been used to help us understand chemical reactions, gene-regulation networks, mental disorders, political alliances, and more!

I'll explain attractors using an environmental example. Let's say you're a fisherman on a small, sucky pond. You can exhaust your natural resources of fish pretty easily:

// catch/release fish, and drag slider

Fortunately, fish reproduce, so your population of fish will grow back over time. Unfortunately, *above* some threshold, fish die from overpopulation. And double unfortunately, *below* some threshold, fish are too sparse to reproduce fast enough to outweigh natural deaths.

// pic: feedback loops "reproduce faster!"

Now, let's go fishing, with these forces of growth & death:

// with growing & shrinking

Notice that we've got two **attractors!** If you don't catch too much fish in one go, the ecosystem stays "attracted" to Population=70. However, if you catch even a *little* bit too much, the entire ecosystem is quickly "attracted" to Population=0.

Nothing much changes â€“ then, everything changes.

(P.S: Population=30 is a **repeller,** because if the population is slightly below or above 30, it's "repelled" away from 30. If this sim, you could balance the ecosystem *exactly* at 30, but it's unlikely in real life.)

Wouldn't it be nice to see, *at a glance*, exactly how the system would behave at all these different population levels? That's where attractor landscape diagrams come in! If we convert the system's speed & direction () into a series of hill slopes â€“ faster speeds mean steeper slopes () â€“ and then we put a ball () on top, we get something like this:

// they see me rolling attractor landscape!

In this landscape, **mountains () are repellers, and valleys () are attractors**.

The *depth* of a valley is how much **"energy"** it takes to escape the attractor. (e.g: you can easily escape Population=70 by catching too much fish, but Population=0 is much harder to escape)

The *width* of a valley is called the **"basin of attraction"** â€“ the range within which the attractor, well, attracts. (e.g: Population=70's basin of attraction is anything within 30<Populationâ‰¤100)

// pic of depth & width

And the depth and width of valleys in the attractor landscape are, ultimately, caused by the feedback loops () at the core of the system!
In this ball-and-hill metaphor, catching & releasing fish is you trying to *move the ball*. But when it comes to complex systems, sometimes it's better to *move the hills:*

// THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF SYSTEMS landscape with hill changers

In real life, **"changing the hills" means changing the feedback loops.**

For this environmental example, you may change the hills by changing the amount of fish prey/predators in the ecosystem. But now, let's revisit the dictatorship/democracy example, to *really* see how you can use attractor landscape diagrams to think about systems:

// dictatorship & democracy comic (stable | stable)    
// Both dictatorships and democracies are stable.    
// It will take a *lot* of effort to "move the ball" from dictatorship to democracy...    
// But if the "democracy" attractor/valley isn't deep enough, it could just take one small event to undo all your progress.    
// However, if you first *move the hills* (e.g. by changing the culture)...    
// it becomes a *lot* easier to move the ball, *and* a lot more likely that the ball *stays* there.

And it's not just fish and democracies. Here's some other images of attractor landscape diagrams from actual scientific papers (you can tell they're from academia, because of how Powerpoint-y they look):

(Note: you can have attractor landscapes in more than just two dimensions! In fact, in three dimensions or higher, you can get what are called **"strange attractors"**. However, 3+ dimensions are much harder to visualize on flat screens, so, whatever.)

Finally, let's see our fishing sim again, all together now:

// final sim

So, the next time you're wondering why things are stuck a certain way, think about:

* What are the "attractors" of this system?
* How "deep" are the valleys? (deeper = harder to escape)
* How "wide" are the valleys? (wider = bigger range of attraction) 
* Can we not just move the ball, but *move the hills?*

And if you ever find yourself frustrated by the world, remember: for many complex systems, for long periods of time, nothing much changes.

Then, everything changes.

*Everything stays    
Right where you left it    
Everything stays    
But it still changes    
Ever so slightly    
Daily and nightly    
In little ways    
When everything stays*
