<p>A pro-democracy movement can rally against a dictatorship for years and years, and nothing much changes. Then suddenly, <em>everything</em> changes.</p>

<p>Why do many complex systems â€“ governments, environments, economies â€“ seem stuck (or if good, &quot;stable&quot;) despite lots of effort to change them? And why, when change <em>does</em> come, it seems to change (or if bad, &quot;collapse&quot;) all at once?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a tool that can help us understand this: <strong>attractor landscape diagrams</strong>. Or, in less pretentious words: &quot;you draw a ball rolling down some hills&quot;. This tool was first created in the field of physics, but has since then been used to help us understand chemical reactions, gene-regulation networks, mental disorders, political alliances, and more!</p>

<p>// add pics here</p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain attractors using an environmental example. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a fisherman on a small, sucky pond. You can exhaust your natural resources of fish pretty easily:</p>

<p>// catch/release fish, and drag slider</p>

<p>Fortunately, fish reproduce, so your population of fish will grow back over time. Unfortunately, <em>above</em> some threshold, fish die from overpopulation. And double unfortunately, <em>below</em> some threshold, fish are too sparse to reproduce fast enough to outweigh natural deaths.</p>

<p>// pic: feedback loops &quot;reproduce faster!&quot;</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s go fishing, with these forces of growth &amp; death:</p>

<p>// with growing &amp; shrinking</p>

<p>Notice that we&#39;ve got two <strong>attractors!</strong> If you don&#39;t catch too much fish in one go, the ecosystem stays &quot;attracted&quot; to Population=70. However, if you catch even a <em>little</em> bit too much, the entire ecosystem is quickly &quot;attracted&quot; to Population=0.</p>

<p>Nothing much changes â€“ then, everything changes.</p>

<p>(P.S: Population=30 is a <strong>repeller,</strong> because if the population is slightly below or above 30, it&#39;s &quot;repelled&quot; away from 30. If this sim, you could balance the ecosystem <em>exactly</em> at 30, but it&#39;s unlikely in real life.)</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to see, <em>at a glance</em>, exactly how the system would behave at all these different population levels? That&#39;s where attractor landscape diagrams come in! If we convert the system&#39;s speed &amp; direction () into a series of hill slopes â€“ faster speeds mean steeper slopes () â€“ and then we put a ball () on top, we get something like this:</p>

<p>// they see me rolling attractor landscape!</p>

<p>In this landscape, <strong>mountains () are repellers, and valleys () are attractors</strong>.</p>

<p>The <em>depth</em> of a valley is how much <strong>&quot;energy&quot;</strong> it takes to escape the attractor. (e.g: you can easily escape Population=70 by catching too much fish, but Population=0 is much harder to escape)</p>

<p>The <em>width</em> of a valley is called the <strong>&quot;basin of attraction&quot;</strong> â€“ the range within which the attractor, well, attracts. (e.g: Population=70&#39;s basin of attraction is anything within 30&lt;Populationâ‰¤100)</p>

<p>// pic of depth &amp; width</p>

<p>And the depth and width of valleys in the attractor landscape are, ultimately, caused by the feedback loops () at the core of the system!
In this ball-and-hill metaphor, catching &amp; releasing fish is you trying to <em>move the ball</em>. But when it comes to complex systems, sometimes it&#39;s better to <em>move the hills:</em></p>

<p>// THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF SYSTEMS landscape with hill changers</p>

<p>In real life, <strong>&quot;changing the hills&quot; means changing the feedback loops.</strong></p>

<p>For this environmental example, you may change the hills by changing the amount of fish prey/predators in the ecosystem. But now, let&#39;s revisit the dictatorship/democracy example, to <em>really</em> see how you can use attractor landscape diagrams to think about systems:</p>

<p>// dictatorship &amp; democracy comic (stable | stable)<br>
// Both dictatorships and democracies are stable.<br>
// It will take a <em>lot</em> of effort to &quot;move the ball&quot; from dictatorship to democracy...<br>
// But if the &quot;democracy&quot; attractor/valley isn&#39;t deep enough, it could just take one small event to undo all your progress.<br>
// However, if you first <em>move the hills</em> (e.g. by changing the culture)...<br>
// it becomes a <em>lot</em> easier to move the ball, <em>and</em> a lot more likely that the ball <em>stays</em> there.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just fish and democracies. Here&#39;s some other images of attractor landscape diagrams from actual scientific papers (you can tell they&#39;re from academia, because of how Powerpoint-y they look):</p>

<p>// pics</p>

<p>(Note: you can have attractor landscapes in more than just two dimensions! In fact, in three dimensions or higher, you can get what are called <strong>&quot;strange attractors&quot;</strong>. However, 3+ dimensions are much harder to visualize on flat screens, so, whatever.)</p>

<p>Finally, let&#39;s see our fishing sim again, all together now:</p>

<p>// final sim</p>

<p>So, the next time you&#39;re wondering why things are stuck a certain way, think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the &quot;attractors&quot; of this system?</li>
<li>How &quot;deep&quot; are the valleys? (deeper = harder to escape)</li>
<li>How &quot;wide&quot; are the valleys? (wider = bigger range of attraction) </li>
<li>Can we not just move the ball, but <em>move the hills?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>And if you ever find yourself frustrated by the world, remember: for many complex systems, for long periods of time, nothing much changes.</p>

<p>Then, everything changes.</p>

<p><em>Everything stays<br>
Right where you left it<br>
Everything stays<br>
But it still changes<br>
Ever so slightly<br>
Daily and nightly<br>
In little ways<br>
When everything stays</em></p>
