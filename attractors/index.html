<p>A peaceful movement fights against violence and oppression for years, and nothing much changes. Then, <em>everything</em> changes.</p>

<p>Why do many complex systems – cultures, environments, economies – seem stuck (or if good, "stable") despite lots of effort to change them? And why, when change <em>does</em> come, it seems to cascade (or if bad, "collapse") all at once?</p>

<p>There's a tool that can help us understand this: <strong>attractor landscape diagrams</strong>. Or, in less fancy words: "a ball rolling down some hills". This tool was first created in the field of physics, but has since been used to help us understand genetics, neuroscience, political alliances, and more!</p>

<!-- add pics here -->

<p>I'll explain attractors using an environmental example. Let's say you're a fisherman on a small, sucky pond. You can exhaust your natural resources of fish pretty easily...</p>

<div class="caption">INTERACTIVE! click buttons &amp; drag sliders:</div>
<iframe src="sim/sim.html?mode=0" width="400" height="340"></iframe>

<p>Fortunately, fish reproduce, so your population of fish grows back over time. Unfortunately, <em>above</em> some threshold, fish die from overpopulation. And double unfortunately, <em>below</em> some threshold, fish are too sparse to reproduce faster than they die.</p>

<!-- // pic: feedback loops "reproduce faster!" -->

<p>Now, let's go fishing, with these forces of growth &amp; death:</p>

<iframe src="sim/sim.html?mode=1" width="400" height="380"></iframe>

<p>If you don't catch too much fish, the ecosystem stays "attracted" to Population=70.
You're sustainable!
However, catch too much, and the ecosystem's "attracted" to Population=0. You killed them all!</p>

<p>Nothing much changes. Then, everything changes.</p>

<p>This is why Population=0 and Population=70 are called <b>attractors</b>: because they "attract" the system to it. Likewise, Population=30 is called a <b>repeller</b>, because if the population is slightly below or above 30, it's "repelled" away from 30. Population=30 is also called a <b>tipping point</b> because that's where the ecosystem "tips" from the Population=70 attractor to the Population=0 attractor.</p>

<p>Oof, that's a lot of words. Wouldn't it be nice to just <i>see</i> how the system behaves at <em>all</em> possible population numbers? That's where attractor landscapes help! If we convert the speed of growth/death <img class="icon" src="icons/speed.png"/> into a series of hill slopes <img class="icon" src="icons/slopes.png"/> (faster speeds &rarr; steeper slopes) and put a ball <img class="icon" src="icons/ball.png"/> on top, we get something like this:</p>

<!-- they see me rolling attractor landscape! -->

<iframe src="sim/sim.html?mode=2" width="400" height="340"></iframe>

<p>Now, as a landscape, seeing what the system does is easy! <b>Mountains <img class="icon" src="icons/mountain.png"/> are repellers</b>; <b>Valleys <img class="icon" src="icons/valley.png"/> are attractors</b>.</p>

<p>The <em>depth</em> of a valley is how much <strong>energy</strong> it takes to escape the attractor. (e.g: 
Population=0 is deeper than Population=70; that's why it's easier to collapse an ecosystem than to restore it.)</p>

<p>The <em>width</em> of a valley is called the <strong>basin of attraction</strong> – the range within which the attractor, well, attracts. (e.g: Population=70's basin of attraction is anything within 30&lt;Population≤100)</p>

<!-- // pic of depth &amp; width -->

<p>(Note: our attractor landscape is 2D, because we only have one parameter: Population. If we had more parameters, we could have a 3D landscape, or even a 4D, 5D, or 100D landscape! And at higher dimensions, you can even get what are called <b>strange attractors</b>... but that's for another time.)</p> 

<p>In our ball-and-hill metaphor, catching &amp; releasing fish is you trying to <em>move the ball</em>. But when it comes to complex systems, sometimes it's better to <em>move the hills:</em></p>

<!-- // THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF SYSTEMS -->

<iframe src="sim/sim.html?mode=3" width="400" height="400"></iframe>

<p>
If you just move the ball, it'll just go back to an attractor.
But if you move the <i>hills</i>, your changes will stick!
And you <b>change the hills by changing the feedback loops <img class="icon" src="icons/loops.png"/> in the system.</b>
</p>

<p>
Let's see some not-fishing examples,
to show how attractor landscapes really are a powerful way to understand systems!
Here's some landscapes from actual academic papers (you can tell they're from academia,
coz of how Powerpoint-y they look):

<p>Finally, let's see our fishing sim again, all together now!</p>

<p>So, the next time you're wondering why things are stuck a certain way, think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the "attractors" of this system?</li>
<li>How "deep" are the valleys? (deeper = harder to escape)</li>
<li>How "wide" are the valleys? (wider = bigger range of attraction) </li>
<li>Can we not just move the ball, but <em>move the hills?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>And if you ever find yourself frustrated by the world, remember: for many systems, for long periods of time, nothing much changes.</p>

<p>Then, everything changes.</p>
